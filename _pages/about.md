About Me
======
I am Zhang Tianlin (张天霖), a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Liu Yun-Hui](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/) in the [Legged Robot Lab](https://cuhkleggedrobotlab.github.io/).

My research focuses on whole-body control, multi-contact planning, and other related topics in robotics. Some of my work can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsGxiYkqGvwHsZz1F8rHug) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/3289375) (for viewers in China).

Before starting Ph.D., I earned a Master’s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (2024), where I was advised by Prof. [Xiong Xiaogang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xiongxiaogang) and conducted research on loco-manipulation for quadruped manipulator robots. Prior to that, I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor’s degree from Changsha University of Science and Technology (2021), where I worked on visual servoing for aerial manipulator robots under the supervision of Prof. [Zhang Hui](https://robotics.hnu.edu.cn/info/1176/2966.htm) and Prof. [Zhong Hang](https://robotics.hnu.edu.cn/info/1176/2957.htm).
