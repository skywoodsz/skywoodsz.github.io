## Current
*I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Robotics.*
*If you are interested in my research, please contact me by email at <skywoodszcn@gmail.com>.* 

## Biography
I am Tianlin Zhang (张天霖), a Control Engineering graduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ).
I have committed to diverse research on optimal control, SLAM, visual servoing, planning, and pose estimation. 
My research aims to make robots cognitive and athletic in real-world environments.
I have accumulated relatively rich research and development experience with various robots, like legged robots, UAVs, and mobile manipulators.
You can explore my work on platforms like [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsGxiYkqGvwHsZz1F8rHug) or [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/3289375) (for China). 
Further details about my background and accomplishments can be accessed in my [Curriculum Vitae](https://skywoodsz.github.io/cv).
